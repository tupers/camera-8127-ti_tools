<td>Location</td>
<td>The directory name and path on the media (or in an archive) where 
                    the Software is located.</td>

<tr>
<td>Delivered As</td>
<td>This field will either be "Source", "Binary" or "Source and Binary" 
                    and is the form the content of the Software is delivered in.  If the 
                    Software is delivered in an archive format, this field applies to 
                    the contents of the archive. If the word Limited is used with Source,

<td>Modified by TI</td>
<td>This field will either be "Yes" or "No". A "Yes" means TI has made 
                    changes to the Software. A "No" means TI has not made any changes. 
                    Note: This field is not applicable for Software "Obtained from" TI.</td>

                    It may be a URL to an Open Source site, a 3rd party licensor, or TI 
                    (if TI developed the software). If this field contains a link to Open 
                    Source software, the date TI downloaded the Software is also recorded.
