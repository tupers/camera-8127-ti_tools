How to use the run scripts supplied with the OMP product

1) Edit 'DEBUGSERVER' in common_variables.bat to point to your CCS installation

2) Create a new platforms\[MYCONFIG].xs file using an existing one
   (i.e. evm6678_xds560.xs) as a template.

    a) Place your .ccxml file in a place where the scripts can access them
       (i.e. OMP_INSTALL_DIR\packages\regression\common\ccxml).  Point your
       platforms\[MYCONFIG].xs file to that .ccxml file using the following
       syntax:

       Main.ccxmlConfigFile = "regression/common/ccxml/evm6678_xds560.ccxml";


    b) Make sure that the platform name in the first argument to 'Main.addCpu'
       matches your platform name.  

       
3) Run the script as follows (the -n flag should be used to specify the number
   of cores that the tests runs on)

V:\omp_1_00_00_xx_eng\packages\runscript>run.bat platforms\evm6678_xds560.xs 
    v:\ti\omp\tests\whole_program_debug\omp_hello.xe66 -n 4

Connected to cores #0-3
[CORE0]
    Hello World from thread = 0
    Number of threads = 4
[CORE1]
    Hello World from thread = 1
[CORE2]
    Hello World from thread = 2
[CORE3]
    Hello World from thread = 3
